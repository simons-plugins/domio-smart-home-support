# Domio - Smart Home

A modern iOS app for controlling [Indigo](https://www.indigodomo.com/) home automation systems. Real-time device control, voice commands, and Siri integration — all in a Liquid Glass interface designed for iOS 26.

> **Domio** is an independent, community-built app. It is **not made by or affiliated with Indigo Domotics.**

## Device Control

Switches, dimmers, thermostats, sensors, fans, and sprinklers — all at your fingertips. Adjust brightness with smooth sliders, set thermostat modes and temperatures, and monitor sensors with battery alerts. Every control responds instantly with haptic feedback.

## Rooms & Favourites

Organise devices into custom rooms that make sense for your home. Pin your most-used devices and scenes to Favourites for one-tap access. Drag to reorder, long-press to edit — just like your home screen.

## Scenes

Execute any Indigo action group with a single tap. Browse by folder or add to Favourites for quick access.

## Real-Time Updates

Connected via WebSocket, your devices update the moment they change — whether triggered from the app, a schedule, or another controller. Auto-reconnect keeps you connected seamlessly.

## Voice Assistant

Speak naturally to control your home. "Turn off the kitchen lights" or "What's the temperature in the bedroom?" Powered by your choice of AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or others). You provide your own API key.

## Home Screen Widgets

Keep an eye on your home without opening the app. Four widget types in small and medium sizes:

- **Device Status** (small) — single device with live state
- **Variable Value** (small) — single variable name and value
- **Device Grid** (medium) — 2×2 overview of your chosen devices
- **Device Detail** (medium) — rich single-device view for thermostats, dimmers, and relays

Widgets update automatically in the background. Tap any widget to jump into the app.

## Apple Watch

A WidgetKit complication lets you glance at your home from your watch face.

## Siri & Shortcuts

Works with Siri out of the box. "Hey Siri, Indigo turn on the porch light" or "Indigo run movie time." Fully integrated with the Shortcuts app for building your own automations.

## Event Log

View your Indigo event log in real time or browse historical entries by date. Filter by source, severity, or search for specific events.

## Browse & Search

Search across all devices, scenes, and variables from one unified view. Everything organised by your Indigo folder structure with collapsible sections.

## Secure & Private

Credentials stored in the iOS Keychain. Remote connections encrypted via Indigo Reflector (TLS). Local network mode available for on-premise control. No tracking, no analytics, no third-party services.

## Designed for iOS 26

Built entirely with SwiftUI and the Liquid Glass design language. Four colour themes. Light and dark mode. Full VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and high contrast accessibility support.
